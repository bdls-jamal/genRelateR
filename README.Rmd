# genRelateR

## Description

genRelateR is a tool for analyzing global human genomic relatedness across populations. It enhances workflows in bioinformatics by providing exploratory analysis tools for genomic data. The `genRelateR` package was developed using `R version 4.4.1 (2024-06-14 ucrt)`, `Platform: x86_64-w64-mingw32/x64` and `Running under: Windows 10 x64 (build 19045)`.

## Installation
  To install the latest version of the package:
  ``` r
  install.packages("devtools")
  library(devtools)
  devtools::install_github("bdls-jamal/genRelateR", build_vignettes = TRUE)
  library(genRelateR)
  ```
To run the Shiny app(not yet implemented):
``` r
rungenRelateR() # not yet implemented
``` 
  
## Overview
``` r
ls("package:genRelateR")
data(package = "genRelateR")
browseVignettes("genRelateR")
```

`genRelateR` contains 9 functions.

1. ***loadGeneticData()*** loads and formats genetic data from various sources
2. ***filterPopulation()*** filters data based on population, geographic region, or genetic criteria
3. ***computeRelatedness()*** calculates genetic relatedness metrics between populations
4. ***analyzePopulationStructure()*** performs PCA or admixture analysis on population data
5. ***plotPopulationPca()*** plots population structure using PCA
6. ***plotRelatednessHeatmap()*** visualizes genetic relatedness between populations using a heatmap
7. ***plotAncestryMap()*** maps the distribution of genetic ancestry components
8. ***plotMigrationPaths()*** visualize migration paths
9. ***createRelatednessDashboard()*** generates an interactive shiny dashboard for exploring relatedness data
